# Tokumei's First Repo
Welcome to my first repository! ðŸŽ‰

## About This Repository
This is where I begin my journey into learning HTML and exploring the power of AI. I'm still a beginner, but I'm eager to learn and improve.

### Why This Repo Exists
- To practice HTML and version control with GitHub.
- To document my progress and share what I learn.

Thanks for visiting! ðŸ˜Š
